    <h2>THIS IS QUESTION 03 OF ASSIGNMENT NO 03</h2>
    <h3>
      Write a function called fetchUsers that uses the JSONPlaceholder API
      (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of users and
      returns a promise that resolves to an array of user objects. Use the fetch
      method to make the API call and the json method to parse the response. Use
      the filter method to filter out the users that do not have an email
      address. Use the reduce method to calculate the total number of users that
      have a phone number listed. Write code to test this function by calling it
      and logging the result.
