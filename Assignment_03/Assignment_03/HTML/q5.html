    <h2>THIS IS QUESTION 05 OF ASSIGNMENT NO 03</h2>
    <h3>
      Write a function called fetchTodos that uses the JSONPlaceholder API
      (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of todos and
      returns a promise that resolves to an array of todo objects. Use the fetch
      method to make the API call and the json method to parse the response. Use
      the filter method to filter out the todos that are already completed. Use
      the map method to transform the remaining todos into a simpler format.
      Write code to test this function by calling it and logging the result.
